\title{Normal test on the number of records}
\usage{
N_normal.test(XM_T, record = "upper", type = "uni")
}
\arguments{
\item{XM_T}{A numeric matrix.}

\item{record}{A character string indicating the type of record to be calculated, "upper" or "lower".}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of alternative hypothesis, unilateral "uni" or bilateral "bi".}
}
\value{
A  \code{"htest"} object  with elements:
\item{statistic}{Value  of the test statistic.}
\item{parameter}{Length of the observation  period \eqn{T}.}
\item{p.value}{P-value.}
\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of test performed.}
\item{data.name}{A character string giving the name of the data.}
}
\description{
This function performs a test  based on  \eqn{N_T}, the  number of records in the observation period,  to study the
hypothesis of the classical record model.
}
\details{
In this test the null hypothesis is that the expected value of \eqn{N_T}, the number of records in the observation period (0,T) is
\eqn{\mu_T =\sum_{i=1}^T 1/i}
and the variance \eqn{\sigma^2_T=\sum_{i=1}^T (1/i-1/i^2)}; these are the values obtained under the classical record model (see  Arnold et al. (2008)).
The test statistic is based on  \eqn{\bar N_t}, the mean of the number of records up to time t, calculated from a sample of M vectors (columns in \code{XM_T}).
The distribution of the statistic  under the null is   asymptotically Normal.

If the sequences of variables  in the vectors are not i.i.d, but they have a monotonous increasing trend, an unilateral alternative hypothesis must be stated, which in the case
 of upper records is \eqn{\mu_T >\sum_{i=1}^T 1/i} and \eqn{\sigma^2_T>\sum_{i=1}^T (1/i-1/i^2)},
 and in the case of lower records is  \eqn{\mu_T <\sum_{i=1}^T 1/i} and \eqn{\sigma^2_T<\sum_{i=1}^T (1/i-1/i^2)}.
